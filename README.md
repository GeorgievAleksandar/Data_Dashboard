## Introduction

This project dives into the data job market through an interactive Power BI dashboard. It uncovers top-paying roles, in-demand skills, and locations where opportunities and salaries align.

The dashboard was built as part of my Power BI learning journey, combining real 2024 job posting data with visual analytics to highlight key market insights in a clear, single-page design. You can find the file here: [View the Dashboard](./Data_Jobs_Dashboard2.pbix)

The dashboard provides a single-page view of the 2024 data job market. It highlights job counts, skills required per role, and salary benchmarks, while also showcasing the most in-demand technical skills and the top-paying positions. Interactive filters make it easy to explore by job title or country—for example, focusing on roles like Data Engineer, Business Analyst, and Data Analyst to compare demand and compensation side by side.

This project was a hands-on way to apply my Power BI skills to a real-world dataset. I strengthened my understanding of data modeling, DAX, and dashboard design while uncovering insights into the data job market. Beyond the technical practice, the project also gave me a clearer view of which roles and skills are most valuable for my own career development.
